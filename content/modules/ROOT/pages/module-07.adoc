= Secure the Automation Supply Chain

Project signing allows users to sign content like playbooks, inventories, etc that live in a project (backed by a version control repository) and configure automation controller to verify whether or not that content has been changed form the signed versions. This way users can make sure the supply chain remains untampered, from the source repository to running an automation job.

The best way to understand how this works is, as most times, to give it a try. Read on!

== The Scenario

In your lab environment you'll find an instance of the `Gitea` Git service. A Git repository with Ansible content has been cloned to it already (it's actually the repository holding supporting Playbooks for this lab).

You will clone this repository locally to you bastion host and then see how automation controller can be used to check for signed content.

== Prepare Repository

=== Access Gitea

Point your browser to {z_gitea_web_ui_url}[window=_blank] (there is no tab -yet- for it in Showroom).

Sign in to Gitea as user `{z_gitea_web_ui_username}` with the password `{z_gitea_web_ui_password}`.

Look around, to the right in the UI you'll see a list of repositories, click the `{z_gitea_web_ui_username}/{gitea_controller_project}` link. This will take you to the repository.

=== Clone the repository

Next, you need the repository from Gitea in your home directory on the bastion host. As you have already cloned this repo in the first chapter it should already exist. To check, in your VS Code terminal run `ls -l ~`, which should output something like:

[source,console,subs="attributes"]
----
$ ls -l ~

total 4
drwxr-xr-x. 5 {z_ssh_user} users 4096 Apr 24 13:10 {gitea_controller_project}
----

You have to configure Git locally, run:

[source,shell,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
cd ~/{gitea_controller_project}
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email you@example.com
----

== Sign Repository Content

By now we have a local Git repository with some Ansible content, nothing special yet. Now we'll sign the repository content.

We will create a GnuPG key pair to sign our project locally.
Asymmetrical keys are used to validate the integrity of a projectâ€™s content.
The private key from the key pair is used at the point of signing and a public key is used to verify that the content has not been manipulated in any way.
The public key will be used in automation controller to verify signatures later on.

=== Prepare GPG

First we have to create the keys we'll use with GPG. Create the file `/home/{z_gitea_web_ui_username}/gpg.txt` using your favorite editor with the following content:

[source,properties,role=execute]
----
%echo Generating a basic OpenPGP key
Key-Type: default
Key-Length: 4096
Subkey-Type: default
Subkey-Length: default
Name-Real: VerySecure
Name-Comment: with no passphrase
Name-Email: student@localhost
Expire-Date: 0
%no-ask-passphrase
%no-protection
# Do a commit here, so that we can later print "done" :-)
%commit
%echo done
----

Think of this file as the instructions given to the GnuPG library on the system about the type of key pair we want to create.
This creates a key pair _without_ a passphrase (of course, normally you would want to have a passphrase for https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/creating-gpg-keypairs[your private GPG key^]).

Now create a GPG key pair using the `gpg.txt` file. Run the following commands in the Terminal window to create the key pair.

The first command will create the key pair using the `gpg.txt` file:

[source,shell,role=execute]
----
gpg --batch --gen-key ~/gpg.txt
----

NOTE: It can take a few moments for this command to complete!

The next command will export the public key to a file called `signing_demo.asc`. This is a more conventional method of sharing public keys.

[source,shell,role=execute]
----
gpg --output ~/signing_demo.asc --armor --export
----

Check the content of the exported public key using the below command.

[source,shell,role=execute]
----
cat ~/signing_demo.asc
----

We will use the content of this file in the next steps, when we setup the verification of projects in automation controller.

And finally, run the below command to list the gpg keys that exist on the system, this should have only one (valid) key pair, the one just created.

[source,shell,role=execute]
----
gpg --list-keys
----

In summary, your session should have looked roughly as follows:

[source,console]
----
$ gpg --batch --gen-key ~/gpg.txt
gpg: directory '/home/lab-user/.gnupg' created
gpg: keybox '/home/lab-user/.gnupg/pubring.kbx' created

$ gpg --output ~/signing_demo.asc --armor --export
$ cat ~/signing_demo.asc

=== Configure ansible-sign and sign playbooks

Now that we have prepared the signing keys let's sign our `{gitea_controller_project}` repository using the `ansible-sign` tool. First install the tool itself:

[source,shell,role=execute]
----
sudo dnf install ansible-sign -y
----

The first step toward signing content is to create a file that tells `ansible-sign` which files to protect. This file should be called `MANIFEST.in` and reside in the project root directory. So go ahead and create the file `/home/{z_gitea_web_ui_username}/{gitea_controller_project}/MANIFEST.in` using your favorite editor with the following content:

[source,shell,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
recursive-exclude .git *
recursive-exclude .vscode *
recursive-exclude constructed-inventory *
recursive-exclude inventory *
exclude .ansible-lint
exclude .gitignore
include *.yml
----

In this case we just include every file in the repository root that matches `*.yml` and exclude everything else. In the next step we will finally sign the files listed in the `MANIFEST.in` file.

[source,shell,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
ansible-sign project gpg-sign /home/{z_bastion_ssh_user_name}/{gitea_controller_project}
----

The above command tells the `ansible-sign` tool to gpg-sign the `{gitea_controller_project}` project locally.

Once you run the command, you will see that the GPG signing was successful and you can confirm that by looking at the new files that were created by `ansible-sign`:

[source,shell,role=execute,subs=attributes]
----
head -n-0 /home/{z_bastion_ssh_user_name}/{gitea_controller_project}/.ansible-sign/sha256sum.*
----

`ansible-sign` created a file with the checksums of the files listed in `MANIFEST.in` and another file with the signature of this file.

TIP: `head -n-0` is a trick to output the content of multiple files separated by their names as header between arrows.

Again, in summary, your session should have looked roughly as follows:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo dnf install ansible-sign -y

=== Push content to Gitea

To make the repository available as a Project to automation controller, the new files must be pushed from our local Git clone to the Gitea repository. Add the new files for git staging:

[source,shell,role=execute,subs=attributes]
----
cd ~/{gitea_controller_project}
git add .ansible-sign/ MANIFEST.in
git status
----

Git tells you that there are changes to be committed.
Commit the changes:

[source,shell,role=execute]
----
git commit -m "Adding signatures for project"
----

Push the new files to your Git repository server:

[source,shell,role=execute]
----
git push
----

VS Code will open a _small_ dialog at the top of the window asking for username and password, else git in the terminal will simply ask for username and password.
In both cases, enter `{z_gitea_web_ui_username}` respectively `{z_gitea_web_ui_password}`.

== Setup Automation Execution

Now, we have to configure our automation execution to use and verify our signed content.

=== Create Credential with signing public key

The first step is to create a new Credential with the public key file that we exported already.

In the Terminal run:

[source,shell,role=execute]
----
cat ~/signing_demo.asc
----

Copy _all_ of its contents _including_ `-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----` and `-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----`.

In the web UI go to *Automation Execution* â‡’ *Infrastructure* â‡’ *Credentials*. Then:

. Click on the blue **Create Credential** button.
* **Name**: ansible-sign
* **Credential Type**: GPG Public Key
. This will open a textbox for you to paste the public key that is in the Clipboard.
. Click **Create Credential**.

This will add the public key as a Credential in your automation controller.

=== Create Project with signed content

To configure the Gitea repository as a Project we need an SCM credential. Again in the *Credentials* section do:

. Click on the blue **Create credential** button.
. Enter:
* **Name**: gitea
* **Organization**: Default
* **Credential Type**: Source Control
* **Username**: {z_gitea_web_ui_username}
* **Password**: {z_gitea_web_ui_password}
. Click **Create credential**.

Now, to create the Project, go to *Automation Execution* â‡’ *Projects*:

. Click on the blue **Create project** button
. Enter:
* **Name**: Signed Project
* **Organization:** Default
* **Source Control Type**: Git
* **Content Signature Validation Credential**: ansible-sign
* **Source Control URL**: The clone URL of your Gitea repository, {z_gitea_web_ui_url}/{z_gitea_web_ui_username}/{gitea_controller_project}.git
* **Source Control Credential**: gitea
. Click **Create project**

The important part of the Project configuration is **Content Signature Validation Credential**, this tells automation controller to use the GPG key in the credentials to verify the repository.

== Check if signatures were validated in controller

Let's check if the signatures have been checked during the initial Project sync when you click **Create Project**.

Click on **Automation Execution** â‡’ **Jobs** on the left menu and then click the most recent job that ran the project sync for the **Signed Project**. If this job was successful, that means the signature validation was successful. You can also verify this by looking at the tasks in the job run, scroll the job run to find the below tasks:

[source,shell]
----
PLAY [Perform project signature/checksum verification] *************************

TASK [Verify project content using GPG signature] ******************************
ok: [localhost]

TASK [Verify project content against checksum manifest] ************************
ok: [localhost]
----

Above tasks indicate that the signature validation was successful.

== Check with tampered Content

The last step in this lab is to check, if automation controller picks up if the content has been changed without re-signing it, indicating somebody has tampered with the content.

Open the file `/home/{z_gitea_web_ui_username}/{gitea_controller_project}/apache_install.yml` in your VS Code and change something, like set `enabled: false`.

Push the new version to the Git repository:

[source,shell,role=execute]
----
git add apache_install.yml
git commit -m "changing file"
git push
----

VS Code will again open a _small_ dialog at the top of the window asking for username and password, or git in the terminal will ask for the same information.
In both cases, enter `{z_gitea_web_ui_username}` respectively `{z_gitea_web_ui_password}`.

If this change was legit, you would have re-signed the repository content. This way automation controller should recognize the signature of the file is not valid anymore and fail the repository sync. Give it a try:

* In the web UI go to *Automation Execution* â‡’ *Projects* and start a sync of the **Signed Project** repository by clicking the circular arrow icon.
* Check the result in the **Jobs** list!

The sync job should fail and the output should clearly indicate why:

[source,shell]
----
TASK [Verify project content using GPG signature] ******************************
ok: [localhost]

TASK [Verify project content against checksum manifest] ************************

fatal: [localhost]: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "msg": "Checksum mismatch: apache_install.yml"}
----

We changed a signed file and skipped signing it again to see the result in automation execution. The verification failed and the output shows which files were not signed in the Project.
