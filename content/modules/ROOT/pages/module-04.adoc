= Use surveys and the revamped access rights to give your users self-service access

Surveys allow us to build input dialogs and wizards to guide users through the process of providing the required data to run a job.
There are different survey fields including drop down lists, password fields, or simple input boxes.

== The Scenario

The App and Ops teams are quite happy with how you setup the workflow to combine both teams' Ansible content into one automation job.
But something else came up, as the app team has a new Night Shift member.
They would like to allow this new member to:

- Change the content of the web site NodeJS is serving
- Run the webapp deployment job.

However, the new team member should not be allowed to change anything else in AAP for now.
Sounds like a job for Automation Execution **Surveys** and Ansible Automation Platform **Role Based Access Control**!

== Add the survey

Surveys allow to define the content of variables before running a job.
The "Hello World!" our NodeJS application prints out, is actually defined in the https://gitlab.com/ansible-labs-crew/playbooks-dev/-/raw/master/install_node_app.yml[install_node_app playbook,window=_blank] in the variable `content`.

TIP: If the AAP UI is not open anymore, refer to the xref:lab-access.adoc[Lab Access] page for the access details.

So we just need to add a survey to our **Deploy Webapplication** Workflow template.
In the AAP UI, open **Automation Execution ⇒ Templates ⇒ Deploy Webapplication**, then:

. Go to the **Survey** tab
. Click **Create survey question** and fill in:
** **Question:** Web Content
** **Answer variable name:** content
** **Answer type:** Text
. Click **Create survey question**
. To enable the survey, while still on the Survey tab, switch the slider button from **Survey disabled** to **Survey enabled** (it turns from grey to blue).

== Test the survey

Launch the **Deploy Webapplication** Workflow Template by clicking on the **Launch template** button.

NOTE: You may also click the rocket icon on the **Automation Execution ⇒ Templates** page.

Before the actual launch the survey will ask for **Web Content**.
Fill in some text of your invention and click **Next**.
The Review window shows the launch details and at the bottom the text you have entered using the survey.
If all is good, run the Job by clicking **Finish**.

TIP: Note how the survey content is shown on the **Details** tab of the Job view in the **Extra variables** field.
From an Ansible perspective they are actually nothing else than extra variables.

After the job has completed, check the result.
In your **VS Code** terminal, run again:

[subs="attributes",source,bash,role=execute]
----
curl http://{node1_hostname}/nodejs
----

The string returned should match what you entered in the survey.

== Create a restricted user

The second part of your task is to add the new Night Shift user who is only allowed to execute the **Deploy Webapplication** Workflow, but nothing else.
For this you have to leverage the RBAC (Role Base Access Control) features of AAP.

=== Create Role

Since AAP 2.5, access management is handled in one central place across all services offered by AAP.
Automation Execution (aka controller) is only one of those services.
For this reason, we need to navigate down to the **Access Management** section of AAP.
There you click on the **Roles** entry, and make sure you are in the **Automation Execution** tab.

First filter on "Workflow".
You can verify that no built-in role allows to execute _and_ approve a workflow, without being able to modify or delete them.
To do so, click on the small arrow head next to the tick box on the left of each role to drop down the actual permissions.

.Filter Workflow roles

The Night Shift personal though is alone at night and they need to be able to circumvent approval steps or they might not be able to do their job.

NOTE: For sake of simplicity and time, our workflow doesn't have an approval step.
Feel free to add one between the two steps if you happen to have time left at the end of the session.
This said, think about the fact that adding an approval step is adding a manual step in what should be an end-to-end automated workflow.

So we decide to create our own role for them:

* Click on the blue **Create role** button (potentially hidden behind a 3 dots menu), and enter:
** **Name:** WorkflowNightShifter
** **Content type:** Workflow job template
** **Permissions:** (select the following ones)
*** [x] Approve workflow job template
*** [x] Execute workflow job template
*** [x] View workflow job template
* Press the blue **Create role** button

Back to Automation Execution Roles and again filtering on "Workflow", you can easily see that our new role is "Editable" and not "Built-in".

=== Create User

Create now the user as follows:

. In the AAP web UI menu under **Access Management ⇒ Users**
. Click the **Create user** button
. Fill in the values for the new user:
** **Username:** nightshift
** **Password:** {z_ansible_controller_admin_password}
** **Confirm Password:** {z_ansible_controller_admin_password}
** **First Name:** Night
** **Last Name:** Shift
** **Email:** nightshift@example.com
** **User Type:** (make sure everything is unchecked for a normal user)
** **Organization:** Default
. Click **Create user**

=== Create Team

A Team is a subdivision of an organization with associated users, projects, credentials, and permissions.
Teams provide a means to implement role based access control schemes and delegate responsibilities across organizations.
For instance, permissions may be granted to a whole Team rather than each user on the Team.

Create a Team:

. Go to **Access Management ⇒ Teams**.
. Click the blue **Create team** button
. Fill the values for the new team:
** **Name:** NightShifters
** **Organization:** Default
. Click **Create team**

Now you can add the new user to the team:

. Switch to the **Users** tab (staying in the `NightShifters` team view)
. Click the **Add users** button
. Select the `nightshift` user
. Click **Add users**

User `nightshift` is now a member of the `NightShifters` Team.

TIP: You could have reached the same objective by using the **Teams** tab of the user's view instead of the **Users** tab of the team's view.

=== Grant Permissions

To allow users or teams to actually do anything, you have to set permissions. The members of the Team `NightShifters` should only be allowed to modify the NodeJS content.

Add the permission to use the template:

. Open the Team `NightShifters` under **Access Management ⇒ Teams**
. Go to the **Roles** tab
. Click the blue **Add roles** button
. A new dialog opens.
  You can choose to set permissions for a number of resources:
** **Select a resource type:** Workflow job templates
** Click **Next**
** Choose the `Deploy Webapplication` Template by checking the box next to it.
** Click **Next**
** Choose the role `WorkflowNightShifter`
. Click **Next**, review and **Finish**
. A short progress dialog appears, click **Close**

If you go to **Automation Execution ⇒ Templates**, open the `Deploy Webapplication` workflow, and go to the **Team Access** tab, you'll see an overview of all RBAC entries.

== Test the restricted user

You've now setup the required user and permissions.
To test everything, log out of AAP’s web UI and in again as the `nightshift` user with password **{z_ansible_controller_admin_password}**.

. Go to the **Automation Execution ⇒ Templates** view, you should notice that for `nightshift` only the `Deploy Webapplication` template is visible.
 The user is allowed to view and launch, and approve, but not to edit the Template.
 Just open the template and try to change it, there is not even an **Edit** button.
. Launch the Template by clicking the rocket icon.
  Enter the survey content to your liking and launch the job.
. Once the job is finished, check the result by executing once again in the terminal:
+
[subs="attributes",source,bash,role=execute]
----
curl http://{node1_hostname}/nodejs
----

. In the web UI, log out user `nightshift` and in again as `{z_ansible_controller_admin_username}`.

== Conclusion

Recall what you have just done:

* You provided the permission to execute an automation workflow to another user without handing out your credentials or giving the user the ability to change the automation code.

* And yet, at the same time the user can still modify details based on the survey you created.
